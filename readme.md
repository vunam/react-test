## Test

Some answers build in React with Webpack & Babel for ES6.

## Files

If you're going to make changes. Install the packages first. You can run webpack to compile the example. The compiled version is in dist: index.html. Just open/drag it to the browser.

## GIT

I used Git. Feel free to follow my process. I have added bootstrap on the last commit. You can see the non-styled code on the commit before that.
